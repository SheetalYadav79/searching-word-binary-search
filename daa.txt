Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array or list. It operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The algorithm starts by examining the middle element of the array; if this element matches the target value, the search is complete. If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. Conversely, if the target is greater, the search moves to the upper half. This process continues until the target is found or the search interval is empty, indicating that the target is not present in the array.

The efficiency of binary search lies in its logarithmic time complexity, O(log n), which makes it significantly faster than linear search methods, particularly for large datasets. However, binary search requires that the data be sorted beforehand. This makes it especially useful in applications where frequent searches are needed on static data, such as in database queries, searching algorithms, and data retrieval systems. The algorithm is a foundational concept in computer science and forms the basis for various more complex algorithms and data structures.
